# Superhero Dashboard ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Front-end React Dashboard that allows the administrator to add, remove, delete, update (CRUD) operations on Superheroes and any associated super powers they may have.\
\
This project is the front-end which requires back-end API that I have also built, which can be found here (SuperHero API): https://github.com/robertshum/SuperHeroAPI
